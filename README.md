# Unity 3D Project
This contains all of the files for the project besides the terrain, which I had just put into the project temporarily to make the movement of the characters a little more visible. Otherwise, all the scripts are mine. This was just a little side project I worked on during my freshman year at UW. I like working within 3D so it was cool to try and implement and use all of Unity's cool features. This was a personal project done just for fun with the little free time I had, so a lot of the code is not too well documented.
